            <h2>Photography</h2>
            <p>At the age of 17, my passion for photogarphy was born. Initially, photography served as a 
            new outlet of therapy for me, shortly after my father passed away. Little did I know, this <br> 
            passion would soon switch over to something I wanted to make a career out of. Before starting
            school for Graphic Design, where I took several Photography courses, I would learn <br>
            new concept on my on through online courses.</p>

            <p>There are several photographers that have been influential during my development as a photographer.
            I'd love to share a few of them with you! </p>
